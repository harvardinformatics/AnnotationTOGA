# TOGA: exon-aware liftover
This repository is a stub for a soon to be built Snakemake workflow for running [TOGA](https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA), which performs exon-aware liftover of genome annotations from a high-quality reference annotation to a new genome assembly (predicated on the feasibility of whole genome alignment between the two genomes). The [utilities](https://github.com/harvardinformatics/AnnotationTOGA/tree/main/utilities) directory currently contains a handful of python scripts for various steps of the TOGA workflow.
